# Microservice Template

This repository serves as a template for creating microservices in Node.js. It provides a basic file structure and organization to get you started with building scalable and modular microservices.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows the following folder structure:

```
m_NodeJS-Template/
├─ src/
│ ├─ controllers/
│ ├─ models/
│ ├─ routes/
│ ├─ services/
│ └─ app.js
├─ tests/
├─ config/
├─ migrations/
├─ package.json
└─ .env
```


- `src/`: Contains the source code of the microservice.
  - `controllers/`: Handles incoming requests and forms responses.
  - `models/`: Defines the database models or schemas.
  - `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints for the microservice.
  - `services/`: Encapsulates the business logic and performs operations.
  - `app.js`: Initializes and configures the microservice.

- `tests/`: Contains test files and suites for unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.

- `config/`: Holds configuration files, such as database configuration or environment-specific settings.

- `migrations/`: (Optional) Stores database migration scripts.

- `package.json`: Lists the dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the microservice.

- `.env`: Contains environment-specific configuration and sensitive data. (Should not be committed to version control)

## Getting Started
To start the microservice for development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Set up the environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add the necessary environment variables, such as database credentials or API keys.

4. Start the microservice:

## Naming Convention
- Microservice repositories should start with a prefix of ms_.
- Choose descriptive names for your microservices to reflect their purpose or functionality.
